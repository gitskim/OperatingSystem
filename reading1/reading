What is register? It's a special, high-speed storage area within the CPU. A process register (CPU register) is a place to hold data such as instruction, a storage address. A register is 64 bits in lenght in 64-bit computer.

Cache = RAM (Random Access Memory)

* GNU GRUB: GNU Grand Unified Bootloader == is a boot loader package from the GNU project. 
* BIOS: Basic Input Output System = is software stored on a small memory chip on the motherboard. It instructs the computer on how to perform a number of basic functions such as booting and keybaord control. BIOS is responsibile for the POST and therefore it is teh very first software to run when a computer is started.  
* Motherboard: It connects all parts of a computer together including CPU, memory (RAM), hard drives. 
* POST (Power On Self Test) is the intial set of diagnostic tests performed by the computer right after it's powered on. 
* A computer peripheral is a device that is connected to a computer but is not part of the computer such as monitor, printer and 
scanner. 

disk drive is a magnetic plate. and bios can locate the first sector of the disk.  MBR = is the first portion of the disk. It is a little bigger than bio so itcan do more. 
when you pick a kernel, it loads the kernel and luacnehs it
Kernel doesn't have everything you need to have to run on a hardware, which would make kernel way too big. so modern kernels are modular
Details don't matter. Once the kernel runs, it creates the first level process. init() is as user level process.


mklable msdos = mklabel creates a new disk label, of type msdos. mac disk label is only for MacOS whcih only undersands the mac disk label. question? why msdos level? is MSDOS for any BIOS system?

parted /dev/sda -> calling a program named "parted" to partition the /dev/sda 
mklabel msdos -> a new disk level
mkpart primary ext4 0% 100% -> this is wehre a real partition happens. We created a "primary" partition which will fill up 100% of the disk and let it know later we will format it as an "ext4" file system type. 
set 1 boot on -> this partition is now bootable. 
print 
quit

question? if fork failed, can the log file still exist?
question? what happens when both child and parent try to write to the file at the same time?

question? sharing resources when forked?

1.2 UNIX Architecture
Kernel: software that controls the hardware resources of the computer and provides an environment under which programs can run. 
OS: It is a combination of kernel, system utilties, applications, shells, libraries of common functions and so on. 

Shells: A shell is a command-line interpreter that reads user input and executes commands. The user input to a shell is normally from the terminal (an interactive shell) or from a file (a shell script). The shell was standardized in the POSIX 1003.2 standard. 

1.4 Files and Directories

File system: Everything starts in teh directory called **root**, whose name is the single character "/"

* stat and fstat return a struct of info containing all attributes of a file. Attributes of a file are info such as the type of file, the size of the file, the owner of the file, permissions for the file, etc. It can be used like this

```c
struct stat sb;
if (stat(argv[1], &sb) == -1) {
	perror("stat");
}
```
